- specifically designed for analysis and 'source transformation'

- TXL program:
  - description of structure to transform:
    - context-free ambiguous grammar in BNF
  - transformation rules:
    - by example as pattern/replacement pairs

- based on formal tree rewriting

- could we synthesise the transformation examples?
- could the user provide a couple examples and we synthesise from
  that?
