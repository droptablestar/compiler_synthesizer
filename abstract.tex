\title{Synthesising A Compiler\author{Josh Reese}}

\begin{document}
\maketitle
Imagine designing and implementing a programming language but not
having to write a compiler or interpreter for it. In this talk we will
present a system which can be used for the automatic generation of a
compiler. The idea for this work comes from the area of program
synthesis which aims to take a partially completed program, or a
program with `holes', and complete the program.

In order to demonstrate this we have designed two simple
languages. One which contains various bit of syntactic `sugar' and one
which does not. From the specifications of these two languages, and
the use of various simple input programs, we are able to automatically
generate a compiler from the higher level language to the lower level
language.
